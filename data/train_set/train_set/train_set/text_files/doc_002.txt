Title: COVID-19 Transmission and Prevention

COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can also spread through airborne transmission in poorly ventilated spaces. Prevention measures include wearing masks, maintaining social distance, frequent hand washing, and vaccination. Symptoms range from mild to severe and may include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell.
