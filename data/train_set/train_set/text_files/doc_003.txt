Title: Hypertension Treatment Protocol

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is defined as blood pressure readings consistently above 140/90 mmHg. It is often called the 'silent killer' because it typically has no symptoms. Treatment includes lifestyle modifications such as reducing sodium intake, regular exercise, weight management, and limiting alcohol consumption. Medications like ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers may be prescribed.
