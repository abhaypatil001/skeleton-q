Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose). Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, fatigue, and blurred vision. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, medication, and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. Metformin is often the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes.
