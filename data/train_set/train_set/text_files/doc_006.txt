Title: Antibiotic Resistance in Healthcare

Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria develop the ability to survive exposure to antibiotics that would normally kill them. This is a growing global health threat. Causes include overuse and misuse of antibiotics, poor infection control practices, and inadequate sanitation. Prevention strategies include appropriate antibiotic prescribing, completing full courses of treatment, and implementing infection control measures in healthcare settings.
