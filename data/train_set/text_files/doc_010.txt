Title: Vaccination Schedule and Importance

Vaccines are one of the most effective public health interventions for preventing infectious diseases. The childhood vaccination schedule includes vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis B, and others. Adult vaccines include annual influenza vaccine, COVID-19 vaccines, and boosters for tetanus and diphtheria. Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of the population becomes immune, protecting vulnerable individuals.
