Title: Immune System Function and Disorders

The immune system is the body's defense mechanism against infections and diseases. It consists of white blood cells, antibodies, and other components that work together to identify and eliminate pathogens. The immune system has two main parts: innate immunity (immediate response) and adaptive immunity (specific, long-lasting response). Immunodeficiency disorders can make individuals more susceptible to infections.
